Detector is a real-time network traffic analysis tool designed to detect Command and Control (C2) channels. It identifies communication patterns such as beaconing and validates suspicious IP addresses and domain names using external threat intelligence sources.

🔍 Features
📡 Real-time network traffic analysis

📈 Detection of regular communication patterns (e.g., beaconing)

🌐 Validation of suspicious IPs and domains with threat intelligence

🔄 Support for multiple protocols

⚙️ Easy to set up and use

📦 Modular and extendable architecture

🖥️ Use Cases
Monitor network traffic as a SOC (Security Operations Center) analyst

Detect potential C2 channels in early stages

Enhance incident detection with threat intelligence integration

🧪 Test Results
The system has been tested under various conditions and has shown:

Successful detection of beaconing and other regular traffic patterns

High detection accuracy with low false positives

Practical usability and stable performance in real-world environments
